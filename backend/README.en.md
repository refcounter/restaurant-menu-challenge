# An API for restaurant orders powered by **Machine Learning**

## Instalation
clone the repo, *cd* to it then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. A local dev server can be spawned with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`. 

Also, there's an **open api** compliant documentation at `localhost:8000/doc` or `localhost:8000/redoc`. Though i recommend speaking portuguese, spanish (or a latin-like language) or a translator software (ie, google translator) on the side.
